/**
 * @noy-db/on-oidc —
 *
 * OAuth/OIDC bridge for noy-db with split-key key connector.
 *
 * This package enables federated login (LINE, Google, Apple, Microsoft,
 * Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, any OIDC-compliant provider) without the server
 * ever seeing plaintext or the unwrapped KEK.
 *
 * Split-key model (Bitwarden-style key connector)
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The KEK is XOR-split into two equal-length key halves:
 *
 *   serverHalf ⊕ deviceHalf = KEK
 *
 * At enrollment time:
 *   1. The full key material is available — the caller holds an
 *      `UnlockedKeyring`. HOW it was unlocked does not matter: a
 *      secret-derived session works, and so does an invite-seeded one
 *      (the firm mints a magic-link invite via `@noy-db/on-magic-link`'s
 *      `issueInvite`; the recipient's `acceptInvite` yields the unlocked
 *      session — the portal client never has a secret of its own).
 *   2. `deviceHalf` is derived: HKDF(deviceSecret, "noydb-oidc-device-v1", sub)
 *      where `deviceSecret` is a per-device random value stored in IndexedDB
 *      or localStorage (never transmitted). A stable random `deviceId` is
 *      generated beside it and stored with it — it identifies THIS
 *      partition's entry on the key-connector.
 *   3. `serverHalf = KEK ⊕ deviceHalf`.
 *   4. `serverHalf` is encrypted with the OIDC access token and sent to the
 *      key-connector server endpoint. The server stores it indexed by
 *      `(sub, deviceId)` — one entry per enrolled device/partition.
 *   5. The server NEVER sees the KEK — only serverHalf, encrypted.
 *
 * At unlock time:
 *   1. User completes OIDC flow → gets an ID token with `sub` claim.
 *   2. Client presents the ID token (+ its `deviceId`) to the key-connector.
 *   3. Server verifies the ID token, decrypts and returns `serverHalf`.
 *   4. Client derives `deviceHalf` (same HKDF, same deviceSecret).
 *   5. Client reconstructs `KEK = serverHalf ⊕ deviceHalf`.
 *   6. Client derives DEKs from the keyring file using the reconstructed KEK.
 *
 * Token lifecycle (LIFF and friends)
 * ──────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC ID tokens are short-lived — LINE LIFF ID tokens expire after ~1 hour
 * and LIFF has NO silent refresh. Two rules keep that livable:
 *
 *   - Expiry is checked CLIENT-SIDE, BEFORE any network call: an expired
 *     token surfaces as the typed `OidcTokenError` from `enrollOidc`,
 *     `unlockOidc`, `listOidcDevices`, and `revokeOidcDevice`. Apps map it
 *     to a re-auth prompt (`liff.login()` on LINE).
 *   - **An unlocked session survives token expiry.** The ID token is needed
 *     exactly once — at serverHalf fetch (or PUT) time. The returned
 *     `UnlockedKeyring` holds DEKs only; nothing in this package retains or
 *     re-checks the token after unlock. Mid-session expiry never tears down
 *     the session — only the NEXT connector call needs a fresh token.
 *
 * Multi-device enrollment — firm re-invite ONLY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * deviceHalf is partition-local by design (LINE in-app WebView, external
 * browser, and installed PWA all have isolated storage). A new partition or
 * device therefore ALWAYS needs the key material once — and the ONLY way to
 * deliver it is a fresh custodian (firm) invite: invite-seeded unlock →
 * `enrollOidcFromInvite` → new deviceSecret + deviceId + serverHalf entry.
 *
 * Device-to-device handoff (QR / one-time code minted by an enrolled
 * device) is deliberately NOT offered: a compromised client device could
 * mint handoffs and silently escalate one device compromise into persistent
 * multi-device access. Round-tripping through the firm makes every new
 * partition an audit point, a rate-limit point, and a revocation point —
 * client-device compromise cannot self-propagate. Enrollment REQUIRES an
 * `UnlockedKeyring`, which only the invite and secret paths produce;
 * an enrolled device holds DEKs but no primitive to mint one for a peer.
 * Expired/consumed/revoked invites fail in `@noy-db/on-magic-link`'s
 * `acceptInvite` (InviteExpiredError / InviteAlreadyAcceptedError /
 * InviteRevokedError) before this package is ever reached.
 *
 * Security properties:
 *   - Compromise of the OIDC provider (stolen tokens): attacker has the
 *     ID token → can get `serverHalf`. But without `deviceHalf` (which is
 *     device-local, never transmitted), they cannot reconstruct the KEK.
 *   - Compromise of the key-connector server: attacker gets all `serverHalf`
 *     values. Still cannot reconstruct KEKs without the per-device secrets.
 *   - Phishing / stolen device: attacker has `deviceHalf` (from the device)
 *     but needs a valid OIDC token to get `serverHalf`.
 *   - Full compromise (OIDC + key-connector + device): KEK is reconstructed.
 *     This is the threat model boundary — NOYDB does not defend against an
 *     attacker who controls all three.
 *
 * Key-connector server contract
 * ──────────────────────────────
 * This package handles the CLIENT side only. Entries are keyed by
 * `(sub, deviceId)` — one serverHalf fragment per enrolled device. The
 * server must:
 *   1. Expose a `PUT /kek-fragment` endpoint (Bearer ID token) that accepts
 *      `{ encryptedServerHalf, iv, deviceId? }` and stores the decrypted
 *      serverHalf indexed by `(sub, deviceId)` where `sub` comes from the
 *      VERIFIED ID token (never from the body).
 *   2. Expose a `GET /kek-fragment?deviceId=<id>` endpoint (Bearer ID token)
 *      that verifies the token and returns the encrypted
 *      `{ encryptedServerHalf, iv }` for that `(sub, deviceId)`.
 *   3. Expose a `GET /kek-fragment/devices` endpoint (Bearer ID token) that
 *      returns `{ devices: [{ deviceId, createdAt? }] }` — every fragment
 *      entry for the token's `sub`. Feeds the firm-side device-management UI.
 *   4. Expose a `DELETE /kek-fragment?deviceId=<id>` endpoint (Bearer ID
 *      token) that removes ONE `(sub, deviceId)` entry — individual device
 *      revocation. Idempotent.
 *   5. Rotate the encryption key used for serverHalf periodically, with
 *      re-encryption at login time (beyond NOYDB's scope).
 *
 * Backward compatibility: a v1 server that IGNORES `deviceId` still works —
 * it degrades to a single entry per `sub` with last-write-wins semantics
 * (enrolling a second device clobbers the first device's fragment; only the
 * most recently enrolled partition can unlock). Clients built before the
 * per-device contract send no `deviceId`; servers should treat that as the
 * single-entry legacy key for the `sub`.
 *
 * Error taxonomy (client sees these as `KeyConnectorError.status`):
 *   - `401` — ID-token verification failed (expired server-side, bad
 *     signature, wrong `iss`/`aud`) → the app re-authenticates
 *     (`liff.login()` on LINE) and retries.
 *   - `404` — no fragment for this `(sub, deviceId)` → the device was
 *     revoked or never enrolled. Recovery is a fresh FIRM re-invite +
 *     `enrollOidcFromInvite`; there is no self-service or device-to-device
 *     recovery path by design.
 *   - `5xx` — server-side fault → retry with backoff; nothing is wrong with
 *     the enrollment.
 *
 * LINE-specific server verification (LIFF ID tokens):
 *   - Verify `iss === 'https://access.line.me'` and `alg === 'ES256'`.
 *   - Verify `aud` equals YOUR LINE Login channel ID (LIFF ID tokens are
 *     channel-scoped; `aud` is the numeric channel ID as a string).
 *   - Fetch keys from the JWKS endpoint
 *     `https://api.line.me/oauth2/v2.1/certs`, select by the token's `kid`,
 *     and CACHE the JWKS (respect HTTP cache headers; re-fetch on unknown
 *     `kid` to pick up rotation).
 *   - Allow a small clock skew (±60 s is customary) when checking
 *     `exp`/`iat` — LIFF tokens are minted on LINE's clock, not yours.
 *
 * Provider configuration
 * ──────────────────────
 * The `OidcProviderConfig` type describes the OIDC provider and the
 * key-connector endpoint URL. See `knownProviders` for pre-built configs
 * for common providers (LINE, Google, Apple).
