/**
 * **@noy-db/on-threat** — threat-response primitives for noy-db.
 *
 * Three independent, opt-in mechanisms (all of which are pure logic —
 * the caller coordinates persistence and keyring actions):
 *
 *   1. **{@link LockoutPolicy}** — N wrong secrets within
 *      a window trigger lockout, cooldown, or wipe. Pure state
 *      machine; caller persists the `LockoutState` between attempts.
 *
 *   2. **{@link checkDuress}** — compare an entered
 *      secret against a stored `duressDigest` to trigger
 *      data-destruct mode. The action itself (DEK purge + keyring
 *      delete) is delegated to a caller-supplied `onDuress` handler;
 *      this package only detects the match.
 *
 *   3. **{@link checkHoneypot}** — alternate duress
 *      secret that surfaces a decoy vault instead of wiping.
 *      Same detection pattern as `checkDuress`, but the caller's
 *      handler routes to the pre-seeded honeypot vault.
 *
 * None of the three mechanisms require server cooperation — everything
 * runs against local state. The combination gives a plausible-deniability
 * model: lockout protects against brute force; duress protects against
 * coercion; honeypot protects against inspection by showing something
 * that survives scrutiny long enough to get to safety.
